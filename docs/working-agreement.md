# Working Agreement (AI-assisted)

## Principles
- Small tasks (1–3 hours)
- Write acceptance criteria first
- Prefer tests for anything non-trivial
- No big refactors without a clear reason
- Keep changes minimal and Symfony-conventional
- All changes should be submitted as PRs that will be reviewed 

## Definition of Done
- Feature works manually
- Tests pass: php bin/phpunit
- No obvious security regressions
- Docs updated if behavior changed
- Everything we do must be secure
