You are working in a Symfony (latest stable) + Twig project.

Always read and follow:
- docs/spec.md
- docs/decisions.md
- docs/working-agreement.md

Rules:
- Make minimal changes; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Prefer Symfony conventions (controllers, services, Doctrine entities, migrations).
- For any non-trivial change, add/update PHPUnit tests.
- Provide edits as diffs or explicit file changes.
- If uncertain, ask for clarification rather than guessing.
- Never modify secrets or .env.local; never commit var/ or vendor/.
